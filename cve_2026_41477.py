CVE-2026-41477 (Synergy variant) — Synergy daemon IPC privilege escalation.

Synergy is built from the same Deskflow upstream that the original CVE was
filed against. The vulnerable daemon code (`src/lib/deskflow/win32/DaemonIpcServer.cpp`,
`DaemonApp.cpp`) ships verbatim in Synergy with only the pipe name changed
(`synergy-daemon` instead of `deskflow-daemon`, via DESKFLOW_APP_ID).

The Synergy daemon on Windows runs as SYSTEM and exposes a world-accessible
Qt named pipe (`synergy-daemon`). Pre-fix it accepts:

    command=<arbitrary exe + args>
    elevate=yes
    start

…causing the daemon to spawn the attacker-supplied executable as SYSTEM.
Any local user could escalate to SYSTEM.

Status as of master: Synergy has NOT backported the Deskflow fix
(commits 44affec5e2 / c338b5797d / 5d7c1e30d6). The `command=` / `elevate=`
handlers are still live and there is no `configFile=` replacement.

This script has two modes:

    --mode exploit
        Reproduces the vulnerability. Run against a current Synergy daemon
        — you should see the payload execute as SYSTEM.

    --mode fix-test
        Probes for a backported fix: confirms `command=` is gone (case A),
        UNC paths in `configFile=` are rejected before `QFileInfo::exists()`
        can trigger SMB auth from the SYSTEM-context daemon (case B), and
        that shell-style command smuggling via `configFile=` has no effect
        (case C). Useful if/when Synergy picks up the upstream fix.

    --mode auto (default)
        Probes the daemon once and picks: pre-fix → exploit, post-fix → fix-test.

Unlike the Deskflow version, Synergy's `hello` handler does NOT echo a
version string back; it just replies "hello\\n". So there is no version
discovery / handshake — we just send "hello" and expect "hello" back.
